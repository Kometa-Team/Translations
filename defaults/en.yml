    summary: "100 highest-rated feature-length animated films on Letterboxd. Minimum
      1,000 ratings. Sequels to shows or anime series—Japanese, American or from elsewhere—that
      need greater context before watching are not included. Those that are included
      can be enjoyed on a standalone basis—and I've taken the decision to remove films
      that only do a brief recap (such as Steven Universe: The Movie) at the beginning
      that may not give the quality of context necessary for enjoyment. The rationale
      for this decision is so that viewers can finish this list without having to
      see a multitude of other episodes and films."
